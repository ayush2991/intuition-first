## 2. Editorial Philosophy

This series teaches physics and mathematics **bottom-up**, not top-down. Every agent working on prose must internalize and consistently apply these 12 core principles.

### 1. Build from what the reader already knows — never from what they don't
Every new concept must grow organically out of direct physical intuition, everyday experience, or knowledge established in a previous section. Never start from the destination (a formula or textbook concept) and work backward to justify it.
- ✅ *"That picture tells us how velocity is partitioned — but not where anyone actually is. The natural next question is: can we draw a map?"*
- ❌ *"Textbooks use a spacetime diagram with space on the horizontal axis. This can be confusing because…"*

### 2. Never introduce confusion first
Do not frame a section by announcing what is confusing, contradictory, or commonly misunderstood before the reader encounters it themselves. Approach concepts as discoveries, not fixes for misconceptions.
- ✅ Pose open questions: *"But what angle does a photon's worldline actually make?"*
- ❌ Pre-announce answers: *"Watch how 90° in Velocity Space maps directly into a 45° diagonal."*
- ❌ Contrast with external curricula: *"In traditional textbooks, the photon is at 45°, not 90° — why?"*

### 3. Pure Constructive Elevation (Zero Complaining)
Teach by illuminating the natural beauty and geometric inevitability of ideas. Never disparage other educators, textbooks, or pedagogical approaches. The universe stands on its own merits without needing a foil.
- ✅ *"Let us follow the geometry to its natural conclusion."*
- ❌ *"Unlike dry university courses that bog students down in meaningless algebra..."*

### 4. The "Pacing of Wonder": Earned Revelation
Build tension through tangible setups (two cars on a field, two synchronized clocks, a loaf of film frames) before revealing deep cosmic symmetries.
- **Narrative Arc**:
  1. *Familiar Anchor*: Everyday tangible intuition.
  2. *The Natural Question*: Pushing intuition toward physical extremes.
  3. *The Geometric Bridge*: Mapping intuition into clean coordinate space.
  4. *The Inevitable Insight*: The mathematical formulation arrives purely as a description of what was already drawn.

### 5. Let visualizations deliver the insight — prose sets up the question
Simulations are moments of active discovery, not redundant illustrations of pre-explained facts.
- **Before the widget**: Establish context, introduce characters, name the open question. **Never spoil the extreme or paradoxical behavior in advance.**
- **The widget itself**: Delivers the answer through direct interaction.
- **After the widget**: Explain why the answer occurred and connect it to the broader picture.

### 6. Introduce characters and terms before using them
Every named entity (Alice, Bob, a photon, a muon) must be introduced with a clear physical situation before being referenced. Every technical term (worldline, proper time, light cone, entropy) must be coined at the exact moment it becomes necessary.

### 7. Self-contained — no assumed external knowledge
The reader arrives with everyday intuition and curiosity. Do not reference what "physicists know" or what "general relativity states". If a concept matters, derive or motivate it directly from first principles.

### 8. Section headings reflect discovery, not taxonomy
Headings should sound like steps in an unfolding journey, not chapter titles from an encyclopedia.
- ✅ *"Drawing the Map: Coordinate Spacetime"*
- ✅ *"The Angle of 'Now'"*
- ❌ *"The Side-by-Side Bridge: Speed Space vs Coordinate Spacetime"*
- ❌ *"Why Spacetime Cannot Have a 90° Worldline"*

### 9. Single Locus of Truth & In-Canvas Direct Annotation
Minimize cognitive load by placing dynamic labels directly where visual attention lives. If a physical value or state (e.g., angle, position, velocity component) is already drawn on canvas vectors/pills or on interactive slider header badges, do NOT duplicate it into a detached telemetry grid.
- **In-Canvas Labels & Slider Badges**: Keep the reader's gaze focused on geometric relationships and direct controls without splitting attention.
- **Adjacent Axis Disambiguation**: When two side-by-side diagrams share a common dimension (e.g., "Time" on both vertical axes), disambiguate them by physical instrument or observer perspective (e.g., `Ground Stopwatch t` vs. `Traveler Watch Rate v_time`), preventing cognitive collisions when one metric varies while the other stays invariant.
- **Telemetry Grids**: Reserve strictly for derived, higher-level invariant metrics that cannot be rendered in-canvas (e.g., Lorentz factor $\gamma$, bit-depth totals).

### 10. Lean Widget Framing (Zero Redundant Headers)
Do not clutter widget containers with repetitive titles or explanatory subtitles when the preceding prose and taxonomy badge already establish context. Let the simulation badge identify the module cleanly.
- ✅ `<div class="artifact-badge">SIMULATION 01 · 2D POSITION MAP &amp; VELOCITY SPACE</div>` (Clean, focused)
- ❌ Redundant widget title + 2-sentence subtitle repeating the preceding paragraph.

### 11. Concrete Physical Instruments Over Abstract Labels
Never use formal academic terminology to resolve conceptual ambiguity. When distinguishing between reference frames, coordinates, or mathematical domains, anchor each perspective in a tangible, everyday physical object or character action.
- ✅ *"Our ground stopwatch"* vs. *"the traveler's personal wristwatch"*
- ❌ *"The stationary observer's coordinate time"* vs. *"the moving entity's proper time rate"*
- ✅ *"Counting the ways socks can scatter across the floor"*
- ❌ *"Evaluating the statistical volume of microstates in configuration space"*

### 12. Launch from the Delta — Zero Baseline Backtracking
When advancing from section $N$ to section $N+1$, never re-derive or re-explain the baseline that was already established. Summarize the anchor in a single clause and immediately introduce the new physical delta.
- ✅ *"In Section 2, we saw that sitting still devotes 100% of motion to time. What happens when you spend some of that speed moving across space?"*
- ❌ Re-explaining the at-rest case with bullet points and full descriptions that repeat the preceding section's widget.

## 3. Semantic Physics & Editorial Color Palette (Monograph Theme)

Colors across the publication represent immutable physical concepts and editorial surfaces under the Monograph theme (Warm Archival Parchment / Scholarly Dark Archive). Always pull colors dynamically from `UniverseSimulations.getThemeColors()` rather than hardcoding static hex codes into canvas scripts.

| Semantic Concept | Light Mode (Warm Parchment) | Dark Mode (Scholarly Umber) | Usage / Physical Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Canvas Background** | `#faf8f5` (`--bg-space`) | `#141311` (`--bg-space`) | Main interactive canvas background |
| **Card Surface** | `#ffffff` (`--bg-card`) | `#1c1a17` (`--bg-card`) | Simulation card wrapper & controls |
| **Card Subtle** | `#f4f1ea` (`--bg-card-subtle`) | `#181613` (`--bg-card-subtle`) | Readout dashboard cards, chip background |
| **Time / Rest Frame** | `#1d4ed8` | `#60a5fa` | Motion through time, Alice's rest frame, $ct$-axis |
| **Space / Motion** | `#c2410c` | `#fb923c` | Spatial displacement, Bob's motion, $v_x$, coordinate distance |
| **Cosmic Invariant ($c$)** | `#6d28d9` | `#c084fc` | Invariant speed hypotenuse $c$, 45° light cone boundary |
| **Light / Wavefronts** | `#b45309` | `#fbbf24` | Outgoing photon wavefronts, beacon flashes, light signals |
| **Sync / Agreement / Entropy** | `#0f766e` | `#34d399` | Simultaneous events, invariant intervals, information entropy |
| **Forbidden / Causality Lag** | `#b91c1c` | `#f87171` | Speeds exceeding $c$, causality disconnect, time lag |

```

### Core Canvas & State Principles
1. **Retina DPI Setup**: Always initialize canvases with `setupRetinaCanvas(canvas)` to ensure crisp line drawing on high-DPI displays.
2. **Deterministic & Bidirectional**: Scrubbing forward and backward must never accumulate state drift. Speed or parameter adjustments must instantly and synchronously update readouts, sliders, and canvas graphics.
3. **Auto-Play + Manual Scrubbing**: Pair continuous animations with interactive range sliders (`.slider-speed`, `.slider-time`, `.slider-prob`). Auto-play demonstrates dynamics; scrubbing allows stop-and-inspect contemplation.
4. **Theme & Resize Awareness**: Register draw callbacks via `registerDraw(draw)` and `window.addEventListener('resize', draw)`. Never set inline canvas width/height attributes; dimensions are managed responsively via CSS.
5. **Edge Clamping for Label Pills**: Always clamp pill coordinates (`Math.min(width - padRight, Math.max(padLeft, x))`) so floating annotations never clip outside viewport boundaries on narrow screens.
6. **Tabular Numerals**: Numeric metrics and readouts must use monospace fonts with tabular numbers (`JetBrains Mono` / `tnum`) to eliminate layout jitter during live updates.
7. **Cognitive Ergonomics & Single Locus of Truth**: Keep live annotations directly on the canvas elements and slider headers. Eliminate auxiliary telemetry grids unless tracking non-spatial derived invariants.
8. **Vector Tip Convention — Arrowheads vs Glowing Dots**:
   - **Velocity Space canvases** (`.canvas-vel`): Terminate every vector with a filled triangular **arrowhead**. Do NOT draw a `drawGlowingDot` at the vector tip — the arrowhead is the sole terminator. Draw arrowheads *after* any other elements so they are never painted over.
   - **Position Map canvases** (`.canvas-map`): Use `drawGlowingDot` at the tip to mark the current position of a physical object (car, observer, etc.). Do NOT add arrowheads — position traces are paths, not free vectors.
9. **Single-Row Controls Strip — Maximum Compactness**: The `.artifact-controls` panel must collapse all interactive elements into **one horizontal line**. Never stack controls into multiple rows when a single row suffices.
   - **Use the `.controls-strip` modifier class** alongside `.artifact-controls` — do NOT use inline `flex-direction: row` since inline styles have no media query support and will overflow on mobile.
   - **Desktop (> 640px)**: `.controls-strip` enforces `flex-direction: row; align-items: center; gap: 1rem; padding: 0.65rem 1.25rem` — all items on one line.
   - **Mobile (≤ 640px)**: `.controls-strip` automatically switches to `flex-direction: column; align-items: stretch` so items stack cleanly without horizontal overflow.
   - **Clock reading inline**: Label, live time value, and rate badge all on one line inside the clock card — no stacked rows. Use `display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 0.65rem` on the card, `font-size: 1.1rem` for the time value.
   - **Slider fills remaining space**: `flex: 1; min-width: 160px` so it expands to fill the gap between the clock card and the play button.
   - **Play button pinned right**: `flex-shrink: 0` keeps it from collapsing.
   - **Drop redundant text**: Remove `clock-subtext` paragraphs and any math badges that duplicate what is already annotated on the canvas.
   - **Reference implementation**: `widget-stationary` (`posts/01-motion-and-time.html`, `#widget-stationary`).

## 5. Responsive Layout & Design Standards

### 1. Dual-Container Discipline
- **Narrow Prose Flow (`.editorial-prose`, max ~680px–740px)**: Longform reading text stays in a focused column where line length (characters per line) maintains optimal reading ergonomics.
- **Wide Interactive Viewport (`.wide-reading-container`, `.wide-container`, max ~1100px–1200px)**: Multi-panel comparative matrices, 3D coordinate volumes, and dual-observer views expand horizontally for optimal spatial clarity.

### 2. Responsive Canvas Heights
- **Desktop (> 768px)**: `380px` (or `420px` for 3D loaves)
- **Tablet (<= 768px)**: `300px`
- **Mobile (<= 640px)**: `240px` (preserves landscape aspect ratio for coordinate systems)
- **Ultra-compact (<= 380px)**: `220px`

### 3. Mobile Layout Rules
- **Side-by-Side Twin Clocks**: **Never collapse twin clocks into a vertical stack on mobile.** Clocks must remain side-by-side (`grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 0.5rem;`) to preserve direct visual comparison.
- **Multi-Panel & 2×2 Grids**: On screens `<= 720px`, collapse 2×2 comparative grids into a single-column stack (`grid-template-columns: 1fr;`) using standardized classes (`.multi-panel-grid`, `.synthesis-grid`, `.expanding-circles-grid`) to give canvas axes adequate horizontal resolution.
- **Sticky Navigation Bar**: On mobile, keep navigation clean (`height: 3.25rem; padding: 0 1rem;`). Auxiliary badges (`.brand-tag`) and secondary navigation links (`.nav-link-secondary`) are hidden on small viewports to prevent collisions.

### 4. Home Page & Section Cadence
- **Brand Identity**: Monogram seal (`IF`) with clean monospaced brand text `INTUITION FIRST` without decorative gimmick ribbons or build bragging.
- **Zero Gap Stacking**: Avoid multiple stacked paddings. The first series group has `border-top: none; padding-top: 0;` so content flows naturally without empty visual voids.
- **Structured 2-Column Grid**: `.series-grid` renders as `repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr))` on desktop, collapsing to `1fr` on mobile.

## 7. Planning & Workflow Rules

- **No Verification Plans**: For this project, the user does NOT want verification. Do not include verification plans, verification steps, or verification plan sections in implementation plans and workflow documents. Keep plans strictly focused on the proposed changes and execution strategy.
